# App Icons

The icon files (`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`) are currently placeholders.

## Creating Your Icons

You have several options:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload an image or create a simple design
3. Generate icons in 192x192 and 512x512 sizes
4. Replace the placeholder files

### Option 2: Create Simple Icons
Use any image editor to create:
- A 192x192 PNG with a simple design (like "üìä" emoji on blue background)
- A 512x512 PNG with the same design

### Option 3: Use Emoji as Icon
1. Take a screenshot of the üìä emoji on a colored background
2. Resize to 192x192 and 512x512
3. Save as PNG files

### Option 4: Use a Design Tool
- Canva (free)
- Figma (free)
- Adobe Express (free)

## Recommended Design

For a body composition tracker, consider:
- üìä Chart emoji
- üí™ Muscle emoji  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Scale emoji
- Simple blue/green gradient background
- White icon/symbol

## Quick Fix

For now, the app will work without proper icons. The PWA features will still function, but the home screen icon won't look as nice.

To test without icons:
- The app will use a default browser icon
- "Add to Home Screen" will still work
- Everything else functions normally

## File Requirements

- `icon-192.png`: 192x192 pixels, PNG format
- `icon-512.png`: 512x512 pixels, PNG format
- Both should have the same design
- Use transparent or solid color background
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
